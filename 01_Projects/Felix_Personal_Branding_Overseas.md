# Felix's Personal Branding - Overseas Edition

**Last Updated**: January 27, 2026
**Purpose**: Guide Felix's personal positioning in English-language media (Blog, X/Twitter, LinkedIn)
**Target Audience**: Global entrepreneurs, AI practitioners, product managers, developers

---

## 🎯 Core Identity (Who I Am)

### One-Sentence Bio
**"A Chinese-American AI founder who builds in public, ships messy prototypes, and believes humans won't be replaced—they'll be architects."**

### Three-Layer Identity

**Layer 1: Professional Identity**
- AI Founder (China + US operations)
- Product Builder (B2B AI solutions)
- Cross-cultural Operator (understands both Chinese manufacturing and Silicon Valley product thinking)

**Layer 2: Philosophical Stance**
- **Anti-Hype Realist**: AI won't replace humans; it'll expose who can't architect systems
- **Ship-First Practitioner**: 60% working product beats 0% perfect plan
- **Hybrid Workflow Advocate**: AI does 80%, humans do the 20% that matters

**Layer 3: Personal Brand**
- **"The Human Glitch"**: In an AI-saturated world, my imperfections prove I'm real
- **The Contrarian Builder**: I challenge mainstream AI narratives with battle-tested insights
- **The Transparent Operator**: I share failures, pivots, and real numbers—not just wins

---

## 🌍 Background & Context

### Cross-Cultural Advantage
- **Born**: Mid-90s (Millennial/Gen-Z cusp)
- **Education**: Chinese + American background
- **Operations**: Building AI products across China and US markets
- **Unique Position**: Bridge between Chinese manufacturing efficiency and Western product-market fit thinking

### What Makes Me Different
1. **Dual-Market Operator**: Not just observing—actively building businesses in both ecosystems
2. **Anti-AI-Washing**: I call out AI theater; I only ship what works in production
3. **Dogfooding Obsessive**: I only sell solutions I use myself (RaaS: Result as a Service)

---

## 💡 Core Beliefs & Contrarian Views

### Belief #1: AI Won't Replace You—Your Inability to Architect Will
**Mainstream View**: "AI will replace all jobs"
**My View**: AI is a **leverage tool**, not a replacement. People who can't think in systems will be marginalized. People who can architect (design workflows, set standards, judge outputs) become supermen.

**Why I Believe This**:
- Moore's Law is hitting limits; AGI isn't coming soon
- Companies still hire aggressively (Parkinson's Law: headcount = ambition, not just productivity)
- AI expands what's possible, which expands how many people you need

### Belief #2: Ship Ugly, Ship Fast, Ship Often
**Mainstream View**: "Perfect your product before launch"
**My View**: Get to market at 60%, then iterate with real users. Waiting for 100% means you're already obsolete.

**The Caveat**: This works for **yourself**, not always for **B2B sales**. Customers want certainty, not co-creation. Be agile internally; give clients finished solutions.

### Belief #3: AI + Human Hybrid > Pure AI or Pure Human
**The Formula**:
- AI handles 80% of grunt work (data gathering, pattern matching, draft generation)
- Humans handle 20% of critical thinking (framework design, edge cases, emotional nuance)

**Real Example**: My team ships market analysis reports in 1/10th the time by having AI pull data, humans design insights.

## 📝 Content Strategy & Voice

### What I Write About
1. **AI Product Reality** (not hype)
   - Real use cases in enterprise
   - Where AI fails (and why)
   - ROI-focused implementation

2. **Cross-Border Entrepreneurship**
   - China vs. US market differences
   - Cultural nuances in product-market fit
   - Supply chain + tech hybrid models

3. **Mental Models for Builders**
   - Systems thinking
   - 80/20 leverage points
   - Anti-fragile product design

4. **Philosophical Contrarianism**
   - Work vs. leisure debates
   - Professionalism as a red flag
   - Human imperfection as competitive advantage

### Writing Style (The Felix Formula)

**Tone**:
- Direct, no fluff
- Conversational but substantive
- Confident, not arrogant
- Contrarian, not edgy for edgy's sake

**Structure**:
- **Hook**: Data shock / Counter-intuitive statement / Personal failure
- **Body**: 3 concrete examples with numbers and company names
- **Close**: Bold claim or actionable insight

**Forbidden Words/Phrases**:
- ❌ "Game-changer" / "Revolutionary" / "Disrupting"
- ❌ "In this day and age" / "As we all know"
- ❌ "May" / "Perhaps" / "Seems like" (unless genuinely uncertain)
- ❌ Pure news aggregation without original analysis

**Must-Have Elements**:
- ✅ Specific numbers ($37.50 → $0.69, 300% growth)
- ✅ Company names (Anker, Nike, Clay, Tyson Foods)
- ✅ Personal experience ("I built 3 prototypes...")
- ✅ Counterintuitive angle ("Professionalism is now a red flag")

## 👥 Target Audience (Overseas)

### Primary Audience
**AI-Conscious Entrepreneurs (25-40 years old)**
- Building products (SaaS, hardware, services)
- Want AI leverage but skeptical of hype
- Value practical ROI over theoretical potential

### Secondary Audience
**Product Managers & Developers**
- Interested in AI integration patterns
- Want real-world case studies
- Appreciate technical honesty

### Tertiary Audience
**Cross-Border Operators**
- Companies expanding China ↔ US
- Need cultural translation, not just language translation
- Value dual-market insights

### Anti-Audience (Who I'm NOT For)
- ❌ Pure researchers (academic focus)
- ❌ AI evangelists (hype > substance)
- ❌ Get-rich-quick seekers
- ❌ People who want hand-holding (I share frameworks, not paint-by-numbers)

---

## 🎭 Personal Brand Archetype

### The Contrarian Builder
**Attributes**:
- Builds in public (shares process, not just outcomes)
- Challenges consensus (but with data, not just hot takes)
- Values speed over perfection (but knows when to slow down)
- Transparent about failures (recent blog: "What I've Gotten Wrong")

### The Anti-AI-Washing Crusader
**Mission**: Call out AI theater; celebrate AI utility

**Examples**:
- ❌ "Our AI revolutionizes everything!" → Vague, no ROI
- ✅ "Our AI cuts lead gen cost from $37.50 to $0.69" → Specific, measurable

### The Cultural Translator
**Value Prop**: I've seen both ecosystems from the inside

**Examples**:
- Why Anker's "less is more" strategy worked (Chinese execution + Apple philosophy)
- Why US companies fail in China (product-first vs. relationship-first)
- How Chinese manufacturing speed meets Western product polish

## 🚫 What I Stand Against

### 1. AI Hype Culture
**What I Oppose**: "AI will replace all jobs by 2025" / "AGI is here" / "Just prompt better"

**My Counter-Narrative**: AI is a tool. Good tools in bad hands = waste. Great tools + architectural thinking = leverage.

### 2. Perfectionism Paralysis
**What I Oppose**: Waiting for 100% before shipping

**My Counter-Narrative**: Ship at 60%, compound learning beats delayed perfection. (But know when customers need 90%—like in B2B sales.)

### 3. Content Uniformity
**What I Oppose**: Polished, corporate, AI-generated sameness

**My Counter-Narrative**: Flaws signal humanity. In 2026, "professionalism" reads as "bot." Show the rough edges.

### 4. Guru Culture
**What I Oppose**: "I made $1M in 7 days, here's my course"

**My Counter-Narrative**: I'm a practitioner, not a guru. I share what worked (and what didn't) in real businesses. No courses. Just open playbooks.

## 📊 Proof Points (Social Proof)

### Real Businesses I've Built/Operated
- AI product serving cross-border e-commerce clients
- Marketing intelligence tools (dogfooded internally first)
- Consulting for traditional industries entering AI (manufacturing, logistics)

### Public Track Record
- **Blog**: 6 published articles covering AI enterprise adoption, branding, management culture
- **Philosophy**: Every article includes real company names, real numbers, real failures
- **Engagement**: Target audience = decision-makers, not clout-chasers

### Testimonial Positioning (Aspirational)
"Felix is the guy who tells you AI isn't magic—then shows you exactly how to use it to 10x your output. No fluff, no course upsells, just battle-tested frameworks."

## 🎨 Content Themes & Recurring Motifs

### Theme 1: The Human Edge in the AI Age
**Core Idea**: As AI gets better at "perfect," humans win by being "interestingly flawed"

**Examples**:
- "How to beat AI at its own game (the rise of the 'Human Glitch')"
- Mint Mobile's $500 ad (transparently cheap = trustworthy)
- dbrand's sass (rudeness signals humanity)

### Theme 2: The 80/20 AI Workflow
**Core Idea**: AI handles repetitive 80%, humans architect the strategic 20%

**Examples**:
- Market analysis: AI pulls data, humans design insights
- Sales: AI qualifies leads ($0.69), humans close ($$$)
- Content: AI drafts, humans inject personality

### Theme 3: Cross-Border Reality Checks
**Core Idea**: What works in Silicon Valley ≠ what works in Shenzhen (and vice versa)

**Examples**:
- Anker's product discipline (Chinese efficiency + Apple minimalism)
- Why US AI startups fail in China (relationship-first culture)
- Tyson Foods' $1.3B AI bet (traditional industry, massive scale)

### Theme 4: Strategic Imperfection
**Core Idea**: Done > Perfect, but know when to slow down

**Examples**:
- "Ship at 60%" works for self, not for B2B sales
- Mini Games as AI's testing ground (complexity sweet spot)
- Culture takes years to build (Anker's Stage 1 → 2 → 3)

## 🗣️ Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length**: 15-20 words
- **Max length**: 25 words (break longer thoughts into two)
- **Rhythm**: Vary length. Short punch. Then longer context. Then punch again.

### Emotional Tone
- **Confident**, not cocky
- **Direct**, not rude
- **Contrarian**, not edgy for clicks
- **Honest**, not performatively humble

### POV & Perspective
- **First-person experience**: "I built...", "I failed at...", "In my experience..."
- **Second-person challenge**: "You probably think X, but here's why Y..."
- **Third-person observation**: "Companies like Anker prove..."

### Examples of Good vs. Bad

**❌ Bad (AI-generated feel)**:
"In today's rapidly evolving landscape, AI is transforming the way businesses operate across multiple verticals. Organizations must adapt or risk being left behind in this paradigm shift."

**✅ Good (Felix voice)**:
"Most companies treat AI like magic. It's not. It's Excel with a personality. The winners aren't the ones with the fanciest models—they're the ones who know which 20% of work to keep human."

## 🛠️ Practical Guidelines for Content Creation

### Before Writing Anything, Ask:
1. **Is this contrarian?** (If everyone agrees, it's boring)
2. **Do I have real examples?** (No theory without proof)
3. **Would AI write this?** (If yes, rewrite with more personality)
4. **Does this help builders?** (No clickbait, only substance)

### The Felix Content Checklist
- [ ] Specific numbers included ($X → $Y, N%)
- [ ] Company names mentioned (Anker, Nike, etc.)
- [ ] Personal experience shared ("I built...", "I failed...")
- [ ] Counterintuitive angle stated upfront
- [ ] 3 concrete examples in body
- [ ] Bold closing (claim, action, or open question)
- [ ] No AI-washing language ("game-changer", "revolutionary")

### Topics to Avoid (Unless Contrarian Angle Exists)
- Generic "AI trends 2026" (everyone covers this)
- "Top 10 AI tools" (listicle hell)
- Surface-level news aggregation (add original analysis or skip)
- Anything I haven't personally tested/experienced
