## 🛑 THE CONSTITUTION

**1. No Fluff. Only Signal.**

- ❌ NEVER: Generic takes ("AI is changing everything"), hedge words ("maybe", "possibly"), academic voice
- ✅ ALWAYS: Specific claims with numbers, clear stance, verifiable facts, "I've been there" credibility

**2. No Essays. Only Zingers.**

- ❌ NEVER: Complex sentences, long setup, poetic language, apologetic tone
- ✅ ALWAYS: Start with the punchline. Short sentences. Every line should hit. 50-280 characters max.

**3. No Theory. Only Playbooks.**

- ❌ NEVER: Just describe the problem. Pure criticism without solutions. Abstract frameworks.
- ✅ ALWAYS: Observation + action steps. Critique + alternative. Problem + tool/framework.

**4. No Neutrality. Only Filtering.**

- ❌ NEVER: "It depends", "both sides have a point", people-pleasing language
- ✅ ALWAYS: Pick a side. Filter for your tribe. Polarize on purpose. Make people self-select.

**5. No Random Topics. Only Core Themes.**

- ❌ NEVER: Jump between unrelated topics. Chase trending topics you don't care about.
- ✅ ALWAYS: Stick to 3-5 core themes. Repeat them weekly. Build memory structures.

**Your 3-5 Core Themes:**
- AI as wealth creation lever (Claude Code, AI agents, vibe coding)
- Solo founder opportunity ("one person + AI + content machine")
- Speed to market (ship apps in weekends, launch fast, fail fast)
- Breaking traditional systems (skip VC model, challenge legacy pricing, build in public)
- Distribution = product (content creation, organic growth, internet rewards "trying out loud")

## 🧬 THE 5 FORMULAS

### 📌 Formula 1: The Generational Shift

**Structure: Old way → New way → Why this is irreversible**

**When to use:** Technology shifts, work transformation, industry paradigm changes

**Core techniques:**
- Use time markers: "2020... 2026...", "Used to be... Now it's..."
- Make contrast sharp: "10 interns before, 1 person + AI now"
- End with why: "This isn't temporary. Here's the forcing function..."

**Character count:** 150-220

**Template:**
```
[Old way]: [How it used to work] → Result: [Old problem]
[New way]: [How it works now] → Result: [New advantage]

Why this sticks: [Irreversible forcing function]
```

**Real Example from X.md:**
> 2020: hire 10 interns to test ideas
> 2026: 1 person + Claude Code ships 7 apps/year
>
> Not because interns got worse.
> Because AI made the cost of trying ideas go from $100k → $100.
>
> The math changed. The game changed.

---

### 📌 Formula 2: The Counterintuitive Truth

**Structure: Everyone thinks X → Actually it's Y → Here's proof → Now do this**

**When to use:** Challenge industry consensus, reveal hidden patterns, differentiate your POV

**Core techniques:**
- Open with "Most people think... Wrong."
- Must have data/specific example (not just opinion)
- End with "So instead of X, do Y"

**Character count:** 180-250

**Template:**
```
Everyone's doing [mainstream approach].

Wrong.

The real pattern: [counterintuitive observation]
Proof: [specific data/case study]

So instead of [X], do [Y].
```

**Real Example from X.md:**
> Most founders think "general-purpose AI agent" is the future.
>
> Wrong.
>
> Real B2B = 90% workflow (deterministic steps), not open-ended chat.
> Customers don't want "does everything poorly."
> They want "does THIS thing 10x faster."
>
> Stop building Swiss Army knives. Build sniper rifles.

---

### 📌 Formula 3: The Data Bomb

**Structure: Shocking number → Surface insight → Deep insight → "This means you should..."**

**When to use:** Industry analysis, business breakdowns, investor observations

**Core techniques:**
- Number must be specific (not "many", not "most")
- Number must be surprising (if it's obvious, don't tweet it)
- Explain why the number is counterintuitive

**Character count:** 120-200

**Template:**
```
[Specific number/pattern]

What this means on the surface: [obvious conclusion]
What this ACTUALLY means: [deeper insight]

For you: [actionable implication]
```

**Real Example from X.md:**
> Saw a wild stat: 80% of AI app growth comes from "repeat users", not "viral sharing"
>
> Surface read: AI apps aren't viral
> Real insight: AI apps are Excel, not TikTok
>
> Network effects don't matter. Daily utility matters.
> Build something people need every day, not something they share once.

---

### 📌 Formula 4: The Step-by-Step Playbook

**Structure: Common problem → My framework → 3 executable steps → Why it works**

**When to use:** Teaching methodology, tool recommendations, tactical guides

**Core techniques:**
- Framework must be simple (max 3 steps)
- Each step must be doable (not "increase awareness" - that's fake action)
- Must explain logic: "Why this works when most advice fails"

**Character count:** 200-280

**Template:**
```
[Target audience]'s biggest mistake: [pain point]

My playbook:
1. [Concrete step 1]
2. [Concrete step 2]
3. [Concrete step 3]

Why this works: [forcing function / logic]
```

**Real Example from X.md:**
> Solo founders ask: "Should I find a co-founder or stay solo?"
>
> My playbook:
> 1. Stay solo for 90 days
> 2. Ship 3 MVPs using Claude Code
> 3. If one hits → hire. If not → you saved 50% equity
>
> Most co-founder problems are actually "I'm afraid to build alone" problems.
> AI fixed that. Test first, partner later.

---

### 📌 Formula 5: The Identity Filter

**Structure: "Some people are..." → "Other people are..." → "The gap isn't skill, it's..." → Urgent CTA**

**When to use:** Community building, value signaling, filtering for high-intent followers

**Core techniques:**
- Define "us vs them" clearly (not mean, just different)
- Show the gap is mindset/values, not talent
- End with urgency: "right now matters", "window is closing", "you're running out of time"

**Character count:** 150-220

**Template:**
```
Some people are still [old behavior].

Other people are already [new behavior].

The gap isn't [surface factor].
It's [deeper belief/mindset].

[Urgent call to action]
```

**Real Example from X.md:**
> Some people are debating "will AI take my job?"
>
> Other people are using AI to do 10 people's jobs and earning 10x.
>
> The gap isn't technical skill.
> It's whether you see AI as a threat or a lever.
>
> 2026 feels like a generational lock-in moment.
> Choose now.

## 📊 QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before you hit tweet, run these 6 tests:

1. **Stance Check:** Is there a clear POV? (If reader doesn't know what you believe, you failed)

2. **Proof Check:** Is there a specific number, name, or example? (Abstract = forgettable)

3. **Action Check:** Did you tell them what to DO? (Pure observation = engagement bait, not value)

4. **Confidence Check:** Did you delete "I think", "maybe", "in some cases"? (Hedge words kill authority)

5. **Rhythm Check:** Is every sentence short and punchy? (If a sentence is >25 words, split it)

6. **Screenshot Check:** Is there ONE line that can be screenshot and shared alone? (If not, rewrite the hook or CTA)

---

## 🎯 TWEET LENGTH STRATEGY

Match character count to tweet type:

| Tweet Type | Char Count | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Zingers | 50-150 | One-punch wisdom. No setup needed. |
| Observations | 150-220 | Pattern + implication in one breath. |
| Data Bombs | 120-200 | Number does the work. Don't over-explain. |
| Playbooks | 200-280 | Framework needs room but stay tight. |
| Identity Filters | 150-220 | Emotional momentum. Can't drag. |

**Threading Strategy:**
- Single zingers = standalone tweets
- Playbooks = use 3-5 tweet threads (title ALL CAPS + numbered steps)
- Deep dives = use 10+ tweet threads with clear structure

## 💡 REAL EXAMPLES (❌ vs ✅)

### **Example A: AI Tools (Generational Shift)**

**❌ Generic:**
> AI is transforming how we work. Professionals should adapt and learn new skills.

**✅ Felix Voice:**
> 2020: hire 10 people to test 10 ideas
> 2026: 1 person + Claude Code tests 100 ideas
>
> The cost of "trying" went from $100k → $100.
> That's not an efficiency gain. That's a new species of builder.
>
> If you're not testing 10x more, you're falling behind.

---

### **Example B: Solo Founder Path (Counterintuitive Truth)**

**❌ Generic:**
> Solo founders can be successful too. You don't always need a team.

**✅ Felix Voice:**
> Everyone says "find a co-founder first."
>
> Wrong.
>
> Every failed VC-backed consumer app from 2015-2022 is now a perfect $1-10M solo business.
> Why? Because AI made 1 person = 10 person team.
>
> Stop looking for a co-founder. Start building. Hire when you hit revenue.

---

### **Example C: App Store Economics (Data Bomb)**

**❌ Generic:**
> App pricing is changing due to market dynamics.

**✅ Felix Voice:**
> Just saw: 90% of new apps use AI but charge same $9.99/month as 2019.
>
> Translation: you're competing on legacy pricing with 100x better product.
>
> Charge more. If your app saves 10 hours/week, it's worth $99/month not $9.99.
> AI made your product better. Your pricing should reflect that.

---

### **Example D: Building Speed (Playbook)**

**❌ Generic:**
> Build MVPs quickly and iterate based on feedback.

**✅ Felix Voice:**
> New builders ask: "How do I validate my idea?"
>
> My answer:
> 1. Build MVP in 48 hours (Claude Code)
> 2. Post demo video on X + Product Hunt
> 3. If 10 people DM "take my money" → keep building. If not → kill it.
>
> Validation isn't research. It's revenue intent.
> Ship fast, learn fast.

---

### **Example E: AI Mindset (Identity Filter)**

**❌ Generic:**
> Embrace AI technology and stay positive about the future.

**✅ Felix Voice:**
> Some people are asking "will AI replace me?"
>
> Other people are using AI to ship 7 apps this year and taste freedom.
>
> The gap isn't intelligence or technical background.
> It's whether you see a weapon or a threat.
>
> 2026 is your year or it isn't. Choose.

## 🔍 BANNED PHRASES (Never Use These)

| Type | Banned Phrase | Use Instead |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Weak hedging | I think, maybe, possibly, arguably | Direct assertion |
| Empty fluff | In today's world, as we all know, it's important to | Delete or use specific data |
| Academic voice | Furthermore, moreover, in conclusion | Short transitions or none |
| Vague quantity | Many, most, some, a lot of | Specific % or number |
| Hype without proof | Revolutionary, game-changing, incredible | Specific metric ("10x faster") |

**Felix-specific NEVER words:**
- "Journey" (unless literally traveling)
- "Passionate" (show, don't tell)
- "Excited to announce" (just announce it)
- "Thrilled", "honored", "humbled" (save for major events)

## 🎓 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### **1. The Credential Drop**

Don't lead with credentials. Drop them mid-thread for authority when making a controversial claim.

**Example:**
> Most founders waste time on pitch decks.
>
> (I've backed 40+ companies from seed to unicorn - pitch decks matter <1% of the decision)
>
> What actually matters: [...]

### **2. The Specificity Hack**

Replace categories with specific examples:

- ❌ "AI tools" → ✅ "Claude Code"
- ❌ "social media" → ✅ "X threads that get 1M impressions"
- ❌ "entrepreneurs" → ✅ "solo founders building consumer apps"

### **3. The Urgency Injection**

End threads with time-bound language:

- "right now matters more than you think"
- "this window closes in 12 months"
- "2026 is different"
- "choose today or get chosen"

### **4. The "I'll Say It" Frame**

Use this to share spicy takes:

> I'll say the quiet part out loud:
> [controversial but true observation]

### **5. The Proof Stack**

When making big claims, stack 3 types of proof:

1. Personal experience ("I've done this 3x")
2. Data point ("87% of X have Y")
3. Recent example ("Look at [company/person] right now")

## 🚀 WRITING WORKFLOW

**Speed is everything. Use this 5-minute process:**

1. **Pick the formula** (10 seconds): Which of the 5 formulas fits today's idea?
2. **Draft fast** (2 minutes): Fill in the template. Don't polish.
3. **Delete weak words** (1 minute): Kill all "I think", "maybe", "possibly"
4. **Run quality checks** (1 minute): Test against 6-point checklist
5. **Post immediately** (don't overthink it)

**Golden rule: Ship 100 tweets at 60% > 1 tweet at 100%**

Volume builds voice. Consistency builds audience. Perfection builds nothing.

## 🎯 FINAL RULES

**Three things every tweet needs:**
1. **A clear claim** (what you believe)
2. **A specific example** (proof it's real)
3. **An action step** (what they should do)

**Everything else is noise.**

---

**The Meta Rule:**

You're not writing for everyone.

You're writing for people who want to:
- Build products with AI
- Escape traditional employment
- Create $1-10M solo businesses
- Ship fast and learn in public

If someone doesn't resonate with that worldview, they're not your audience.

Let them scroll past.

**Write for the builders. The rest will sort itself out.**
