| AI empowers normal people | Tools for everyone | Send this to every normal person you know because normal people don’t want to touch a terminal and this will make them 100x more powerful and productive at whatever is they do |
| Describing wants is the new skill | Future Skills | in an AI world, your ability to clearly describe what you want is about to become the most valuable skill on the planet |
| Ralph Wiggum method | Agent Tutorials | this is the CLEAREST explanation of "ralph wiggum" on the internet and how you can use it with claude code/amp/etc and have AI agents build software for you 24/7 even while you sleep https://t.co/84hvjqX3wd |
| Opportunity with verified tools | Motivation | i regret to inform you the amount of opportunity to build software startups and mobile apps with claude code etc is mind bending at the moment |

| How to Build B2C App 2026 | Guide | HOW TO BUILD A BIG CONSUMER B2C MOBILE APP IN 2026<br>1. start with a single recurring behavior people already document, like meals, sleep, workouts, studying, dating, or routines. <br>2. anchor the app to one question users already ask themselves daily, like “am I doing this right?”<br>3. narrow it to one audience, like college students tracking meals, busy parents tracking sleep, or single people tracking dates.<br>4. design the product so the core value appears visually in under five seconds<br>5. build the demo before the full product and let the demo define the feature set<br>6. keep videos between 20–40 seconds so curiosity builds without dragging<br>7. default to faceless formats like screen recordings, slideshows, or b-roll with captions (easier to do, can do founder led if that's your thing too)<br>8. create multiple hooks around the same demo instead of multiple demos.<br>9. use comparison formats like before/after, expectation vs reality, or me vs me<br>10. write hooks the way people text friends: short, casual, and specific<br>11. treat pauses, rewatches, and saves as the strongest signals of interest (this is v important)<br>12. read comments as public product research that reveals confusion, desire, and identity<br>13. paste comments into Claude Code and cluster them into concrete product changes<br>14. use AI inside the app to interpret inputs and surface one clear answer.<br>15. add a short onboarding quiz so users feel the output is made for them<br>16. deliver a result worth screenshotting within the first session. add CTAs to share. track the % of people who share and iterate to increase this.<br>17. place the paywall immediately after the first moment of clarity<br>18. ship small visible improvements weekly so users feel momentum<br>19. iterate in public so content doubles as changelog and proof<br>20. measure virality through shares and installs per view, not follower count<br>21. design outputs users want to send to friends without explanation<br>22. own multiple posting accounts early to test hooks in parallel (and to own a network of accounts kinda like your modern day media network)<br>23. give each account one format, one hook style, and one audience segment<br>24. scale formats that produce consistent installs instead of chasing one-off spikes<br>25. turn early power users into creators by resharing their posts<br>26. use slideshows as mini case studies that encourage rewatches and saves<br>27. build lightweight community loops like streaks, challenges, or progress updates. could be premium features too but start free.<br>28. keep the product NARROW so clarity stays high and competition stays thin<br>29. convert organic installs into profit early so growth funds itself<br>30. reinvest cash flow into more creators, more accounts, and faster iteration. Understand LTV/CAC extremely well, certain creators will make sense/others not so much. Use AI for outeach.<br>31. Build a portfolio of small apps once the loop works so dividends compound quietly. find more app ideas at @ideabrowser to get creative juices flowing<br>32. congrats, you’ve learned the most valuable skill in 2026...shipping small apps fast, reading the internet’s signals, and compounding what works. <br>33. you set yourself up nicely for 2027 and beyond |
| How to Build Mobile Apps in 2026 | Guide | HOW TO BUILD MOBILE APPS WITH AI IN 2026<br>1. Use Claude Code, Rork, Vibecode app etc to get the first mobile MVP live the same day the idea forms<br>2. Use Claude Code to tighten logic, handle edge cases, and make behavior predictable<br>3. Design the core interaction so it fits inside a 10-second screen recording from day one (this is key and is the new ""lean startup"")<br>4. Study top short-form videos in your category and write down the first 3 seconds of each<br>5. Build demos around the hook rather than the feature list (mindset shift)<br>6. Record simple demos straight from the simulator or device and post them as is<br>7. Treat short-form video as a live feedback channel (v important)<br>8. Test multiple hooks for the same app before touching the code<br>9. Watch where people pause, replay, or comment “wait what” to see what matters (in analytics)<br>10. Screenshot comments that explain the product clearly and reuse that language<br>11. Paste comments into Claude Code and ask it to cluster feedback into concrete product changes<br>12. Ship the smallest change that makes the demo clearer<br>13. Use Claude Code to push those changes fast and re-record the demo the same day (can be founder led or find someone or ai avatar)<br>14. Repeat this loop daily until the app explains itself without narration<br>15. Let the demo become the distribution engine. This is your north star.<br>16. Add a paywall once curiosity appears to test willingness to pay<br>17. Add a one-question or short quiz in onboarding to create investment early<br>18. Use quiz answers to personalize the first output so it feels made for the user<br>19. Show the result immediately after onboarding to reinforce that the input mattered<br>20. Surface one clear “this is why this matters” insight right after first use<br>21. Save the first output so users feel ownership and return to it<br>22. Ask for one small follow-up action after value appears to deepen commitment<br>23. Turn common onboarding answers into new demo angles for content<br>24. Highlight progress or change over time with a simple before-and-after view<br>25. Trigger reengagement when the output meaningfully changes<br>26. Let users export or share their result in a way that preserves context (and that helps drive virality)<br>27. Continuously improve onboarding copy with Claude Code based on what converts<br>28. Lock in the hook when people start explaining the app to each other<br>29. Increase posting volume after the format proves consistent. Keep experimenting<br>30. Shape the product around what performs on video<br>31. TLDR: Ship → demo → observe reactions → tighten the loop → charge → repeat until momentum compounds<br>32. PMF incoming (hopefully). Take dividends, reinvest in new apps (buy or build) or raise VC if you fancy that.<br>33. You just built a mobile app with AI. |

| Better AI Image Tools | Testing new ChatGPT image model | I tested the new ChatGPT image model and it feels calmer to use (and 4x faster). <br>You can iterate without starting over every time. Faces, layout, and lighting mostly stay consistent as you tweak things. <br>That small change makes a big difference. https://t.co/6ws0deDaGy |

| Fake Experts & Influence Farming | Social Media Dynamics | I find this extremely lame and i'll call it out.<br>All of these X accounts are fake based in India or ""West Asia"" yet pretty well-known people interact with them and follow them.<br>Someone creates an account claims a role at a frontier AI lab based in SF (it's a lie), and then mostly curates smart-sounding charts, threads, and takes from other people usually without credit.<br>They often use the format ""this guy literally xyz...."" <br>Over time, a network of these accounts boosts each other, making the signals look even stronger, and my guess is that the endgame is selling influence, distribution, or “growth” or AI automation services once the audience is large enough.<br>I have seen tons of these accounts recently and maybe you have too. |

| Rebuild failed VC apps | Solo Business Ideas | every failed VC-backed consumer app from 2015-2022 is now a perfect $1-10M solo business just waiting for someone with claude code etc to rebuild it in a weekend and unleash a flood of UGC creators behind it <br>go find those ""we're sunsetting"" emails like there is no tomorrow |
| Cancer screening at home ($MYNZ) | Biotech / Healthcare | 🧬 Why $MYNZ is positioned to change cancer screening forever<br>Mainz Biomed N.V. is tackling one of healthcare’s biggest failures: late cancer detection. Colorectal cancer alone causes ~900,000 deaths per year globally, yet screening participation in some regions is below 60% due to invasive procedures and poor compliance.<br>MYNZ is changing that with non-invasive, at-home molecular tests powered by AI + mRNA biomarkers. In feasibility studies, MYNZ has reported up to 100% sensitivity and ~95% specificity in certain biomarker panels—numbers that matter when lives are on the line.<br>Their eAArly DETECT 2 U.S. study targets ~2,000 patients, a critical step toward FDA pivotal trials. Early detection can improve survival rates by 3×–5×, while reducing treatment costs by 30–50% compared to late-stage care.<br>The global cancer diagnostics market exceeds $70B, growing at >8% CAGR. MYNZ isn’t just building a test—they’re building the future of preventive, scalable, self-testing healthcare.<br>Early. Accurate. At home. |
| Alibaba Accio Agent | Ecommerce | I spent some time testing Alibaba’s new AI agent platform ""Accio"", which 99.9% of people haven't tried, and it genuinely surprised me. <br>It spots trends, turning them into concrete product ideas, designs the products and then matches you with real suppliers on Alibaba who can build them. <br>Crazy!<br>It reads reviews and complaints to figure out why products underperform, then suggests how to fix that in a new concept.<br>Kinda felt like an AI ecommerce co-founder.<br>Not affiliated with alibaba (duh), but thought it was cool so did an episode @startupideaspod on it. <br>I'm sharing the episode in case you might find it interesting too.<br>https://t.co/dfJZThiQUQ<br>Tempts me to build an ecommece company. |

| Claude Code Side Project | Origin Story | The guy who built Claude code admitted that it started as a side project  🤯 |
| Vibe Revenue vs Real PMF | Business Model Warning | I'll say the quiet parts out loud:<br>A lot of AI companies that raised $10M, $50M, even $250M+ have SERIOUS churn problems. <br>A lot of AI products get tried because they’re the cool new thing. People sign up, poke around, feel the wow moment, tell a friend, maybe even pay for a month or two. Then real life kicks in and the subscription quietly gets canceled 3-6 months later.<br>I call this ""vibe revenue"". <br>Money that comes from curiosity, novelty, or FOMO rather than a product becoming essential to someone’s workflow. <br>People pay because it’s cool to try, not because they can’t imagine their week without it.<br>The dangerous part is that vibe revenue looks exactly like PMF at first!!<br>Growth curves go up and to the right. Feedback sounds positive. <br>Founders keep saying “this is the worst the models will ever be.” when confronted with churn.<br>If I had a nickel, everytime I heard that!<br>But the truth is better models don’t automatically create habits. They don’t fix shallow integration or give a product staying power.<br>In AI, switching costs are low and alternatives show up weekly. Curiosity can carry revenue longer than it should, especially when capital is plentiful. Some of these companies will keep raising. Many will hit a wall when retention tells the full story.<br>A lot of employees who on paper will think they are millionaires will learn this lesson the hard way.<br>The businesses that survive feel different. <br>They get used on boring days, stressful days, and busy days. They don’t rely on wow moments. <br>They earn a permanent slot in how work actually happens and they'll deserve the valuation, the funding etc.<br>Vibe revenue, it's everywhere. Stay safe out there.<br>Am I wrong? |
| Agency + AI Skills Model | Business Model | This feels directionally right.<br>An agency comes in for a few weeks, maps how work actually flows, and installs claude skills/agents that handle reporting, follow-ups, checks, and coordination.<br>That replaces work spread across a few roles that might cost $250k–$400k a year.<br>The company pays once for the setup, keeps the system, and only brings the agency back when something needs tuning.<br>Of course agencies don’t go away since human judgment is always needed, but a growing share of what clients pay for shifts toward skills and agents that run inside the business.<br>I keep coming back to this idea and it keeps making more sense. |
| Solo-preneurship | Efficiency of modern internet businesses | I keep thinking about how many profitable internet businesses that used to need a team now need one extremely motivated person, AI and an organic content machine |
| Solo-preneurship (Duplicate) | Efficiency of modern internet businesses | I keep thinking about how many profitable internet businesses that used to need a team now need one extremely motivated person, AI and an organic content machine |
| Social App Opportunity | Demand for authentic social connection | It feels pretty obvious at this point that someone’s going to make billions building a social app that’s just for friends, no AI slop, no brainrot, calm design, chronological feed and no concept of followers. |

| AI Giants Valuation Comparison | Investment | Temperature check:<br>Would you rather own stock in Anthropic ($350B val), OpenAI ($830B val) or xAI ($230B val)? |
| AI Wealth Generation | Prediction | claude code will probably make 50,000 people millionaires if not more |
| App Store Explosion | Market Shift | The $1.3T App Store doesn’t DIE. It's going to EXPLODE.<br>Claude Code makes it so anyone can ship an app, which means the App Store fills up 10,000× faster than before.<br>Most are AI junk. But A few are surprisingly good and PERSONAL instead of UNIVERSAL.<br>Apple will get stricter and add more filters. How else are they going to deal with the flood of apps and making it easy for people to find them?<br>At the same time, the types of apps will change over the next 24 months:<br>People start building very specific apps for very specific situations. <br>“An app that tells me if my snoring last night was bad enough to wake my partner” instead of a generic sleep tracker <br>Basically, moving from general purpose to very specific apps that spread through screenshots, screen recordings, and friends sending links. <br>Most of these apps never try to get ""huge"" in the traditional VC sense.<br>They don’t need tens of millions of users. A few thousand people paying $5–$15 a month turns into life changing money. <br>Some people get wildly rich from this. If all of a sudden, they have a portfolio of apps doing $5M in ARR with no investors, they've easily built $20M of enterprise value while taking distributions of $500k+/year.<br>Pretty crazy. People will see this and many will jump into the app building game. It'll get popular and then probably too popular at one point.<br>Lot of people in Silicon Valley say everyone will be an app creator in this new world. I'm not sure that's true. Probably not everyone.<br>A lot of people still won’t build apps, the same way most people aren't youtube creators. They just want consume the content an enjoy it.<br>Over time, the App Store starts to feel different. <br>Basically, software feels more indie, more personal. This era is way better for people who want to build apps, people who want more personal apps but maybe worse off for apple (gotta deal with the slop)<br>But definitely it doesn't kill the app store.<br>The app store explodes. |
| Gen Z Founders built different | Cultural Shift | ive been hanging out with founders under 22 lately living in sf/nyc and they're built different.<br>my observations of these young founders getting rich with AI:<br>1. these kids grew up watching YT creators flexing Porsches and private jets from their bedrooms. but when they looked at their own reality, they saw $200k college tuition and $45k entry-level jobs. the math didn't work. so they decided to skip the broken system entirely.<br>2. that economic reality shaped everything about them. they're unapologetically capitalistic in a way that reminds me of the 80s Wall Street era. pure survival capitalism. they think they need millions just to live comfortably, they look at $4,000 studio apartments in ny, and they're not wrong. tons of economic pressure for everyone right now and inflation worries.<br>3. so they formed group chats with other founders. their mentors are podcasts. they're plugged in and learning 24/7, treating business like a multiplayer video game they're trying to beat.<br>4. sam altman said something that stuck with me: older generations use ChatGPT as a Google replacement, but these kids use it as an operating system. they see this AI era as their gateway out of economic reality. <br>5. everything they do is optimized for virality. their startup journey reads like a Netflix documentary with built-in trailers. every product decision considers ""will this clip work on X?"" they reverse engineer social algorithms with their business models. it's like NELK Boys meets Spielberg meets YC demo day.<br>6. they build products designed to go viral on specific platforms. they'll time launches around trending topics. they'll create TikToks showcasing their SaaS tool like entertainment content.<br>7. some go the cash flow route, building consumer mobile apps like nikita or build saas portfolios. others raise millions in VC funding. the more the vc the better they think. <br>8. they document every failure, breakthrough, and late-night coding session. their businesses are performance art for the algorithm age.<br>9. they're not trying to fix the broken system that priced them out. they're building entirely around it. and they're winning because they accepted the new rules while everyone else is still playing by the old ones.<br>10. a lot will fail in public and end up working at companies. it'll be crushing. especially the ones that raise tons of vc. that's the game. but some will succeed in ways we've never seen before.<br>11. they think in portfolios from day one. not “this is my startup,” but “this is one bet.” apps, tools, experiments, accounts. they expect most to die and one to change their life.<br>12. many are  hyper-capitalistic. michael douglas in wall street energy, but with claude, cursor, and viral clips instead of suspenders and cigars. theyve got big dreams and aren't afraid to go after them.<br>13. the same inflated world that crushed previous generations might have created the most resourceful generation of entrepreneurs we've ever seen. they are turning systemic failure into competitive advantage.<br>pretty genius when you think about it. the kids are alright. |

| Internet Evolution with Claude Code | Prediction | In a year, the internet will be really different.<br>We’re seeing just tip of the iceberg of what Claude code can do. <br>Crazy times. |
| 2026 Startup Boom - 20 Shifts | Market Analysis | 2026 is the GREATEST time to build a startup in 30 years<br>I’m 36. I’ve sold 3 startups, helped build companies that raised billions, and backed teams from seed to unicorn.<br>20 MEGA shifts that make this the BEST time to build in a GENERATION:<br>1. Hardware got smart. Download open-source AI models from HuggingFace to cheap robots and they're suddenly smart. Opens up tons of use-cases.<br>2. SaaS is imploding. AI can replicate $500K software for pennies. Enterprise software that took 30 engineers now requires 1 and a Claude Code subscription. Founders will go more niche and more custom and outprice incumbents.<br>3. Outcome-based pricing is eating subscriptions. With AI agents handling work automatically, founders can guarantee results instead of selling features. This creates a massive arbitrage opportunity to steal market share from rigid subscription models.<br>4. Vibe marketing is the new marketing. AI agents/tools like Lindy, Gemini and Claude Code  Using agents to do personalized outreach, ads and content creation it’s getting good. This is like getting on social in 2005.<br>5. Social is FYP-ified. Distribution no longer requires massive followings,  just content that hits. Founders can build audience from zero without ads and then convert them to owned media channels (text/email).<br>6. Interfaces are vanishing. Conversations are replacing dashboards across industries. This removes training barriers and means customers can use sophisticated products immediately.<br>7. Companies are obsessed with efficiency and cutting costs right now. Corporate budgets are getting reallocated to AI. Companies are cutting traditional software spend to make room for AI-powered alternatives. This creates fast-tracked approvals for startups delivering 10x efficiency.<br>8. 99% of MVPs won't need VC. Low-cost MVPs combined with creator partnerships and AI automation allow bootstrapped scaling. For most software businesses, outside funding is now unnecessary.<br>9. Global teams. You don’t need to hire in your own city anymore. Opens up tons of arbitrage opportunities and ways to create products unlike before.<br>10. Millions of creators want to get paid. If you have the right product, the right network of creators, you can hit scale insanely efficiently. Never before did this exist. Next gen founders are building startups community first, software second.<br>11. Prototyping is nearly instant. With Lovable, Rork etc, you can test ideas in days, not months. MVP speed is basically 1x/week. This creates room for multiple products from small companies (multipreneurship), helps get to PMF faster,<br>12. LLM APIs create building blocks weekly. I can’t even keep up with how many new APIs/tools coming out from LLMs weekly. Example: Nano Banana pro comes out, probably 1000 ideas built on top of that can be $5M/year businesses.<br>13. $1m+ revenue per employee. With the leverage of LLMs, community and agents, employees are way more efficient. It won’t be uncommon to generate $1m per employee. This will lead to a rise of ""multipreneurship"", small teams owning multiple products /businesses. Holding companies will be as common as startups.<br>14. Superniche is the new niche. Because costs to create software startups is 1/100th, you can service little niches (i call them superniches) and still have a life-changing business.<br>15. Mobile app ecosystem about to 10X. 2 reasons. First is, adding AI to apps make apps more useful. More useful apps, make more money. Second,<br>16. Compliance and boring workflows are suddenly buildable. Permits, audits, insurance, payroll edge cases, filings, RFPs. These were “too annoying” for startups before. Agents thrive on rules, checklists, and repetition. The least sexy problems now have the best unit economics.<br>17. Claude Code killed the “engineering bottleneck.” The constraint is no longer “can we build it,” it’s “do we understand the workflow deeply enough.” The winning founders are ex-operators who encode tribal knowledge into agents. Code is cheap. Taste + domain insight is scarce.<br>18. The long tail of software is now profitable. Niches that capped at $200k ARR can clear $5M with near-zero marginal cost.<br>19. Services are quietly becoming software. Manual agencies are one agent away from product margins.<br>20. if AI can replicate $500K software for $20/month, what’s your moat? distribution, customer service, brand, data etc. REALLY good time to be a world class designer/marketer.<br>(and even more.... but this is getting long already!)<br>We've entered the rarest of windows...<br>when multiple technological shifts collide at once, creating a brief period where small teams can build things that were previously impossible.<br>THE FUTURE OF BUILDING STARTUPS IS DIFFERENT.<br>I know this...<br>This unique moment won't last forever. Markets will adapt. Giants will respond. The window will close.<br>But right now, a founder with clear vision and bias for action can build more in six months than was previously possible in years.<br>(note: if you need an idea to get creative juices flowing, grab one at @ideabrowser) <br>The next generation of great companies is being created right now, many by founders you've never heard of.<br>Some by people who would never have had a shot in previous cycles.<br>That's the beauty of these rare windows. The playing field briefly levels, and the future belongs to those who see it clearly and move first.<br>It's a sacred time, don't bookmark/share this, build something in 2026, will ya?<br>Happy building, my friends. 2026 is yours.<br>Am I wrong? |
| Manus AI Acquisition by Meta | Acquisition Analysis | So, Manus AI sold for $1-2B to Meta.<br>A few of my takeaways to people in silicon valley and not:<br>1. Manus treated distribution as a first-class expense, spending heavily on creators to win attention early<br>2. That spend worked because creators showed the product in use, not because they explained it<br>3. The product was simple enough that a demo did the selling without narration<br>4. Manus was the FIRST platform to really own the category of super agent. Gets you thinking... what AI word can you own??<br>5. Once attention was locked in, revenue followed quickly because the value showed up immediately<br>6. Meta probably paid 10–20× revenue for speed, momentum, team and mindshare they didn’t have to build. Not insane<br>7. Manus proved that owning the user relationship matters more than owning the underlying model.<br>8. I guess GPT wrappers aren't useless after all ;)<br>9. Manus' browser operator feature was an ""ah-ha moment"" for millions. Watching your AI actually browse the internet and take actions for you was a game changer and went SUPER viral on social<br>10. The team spent more time thinking about “what will people screenshot?” than “what benchmarks will we win?”<br>11. Manus benefited from launching before the category felt settled or named. What other categories are like this ??<br>12. Agent products win when they collapse effort into a single observable action<br>13. A lot of people in Silicon Valley/tech never used Manus, and it really didn’t matter at all<br>Next tweet on how I'd think about building the next Manus and sell to Meta for a few billion: |

| The 1997 Moment for AI | Historical Parallel | This is the 1997 moment because building AI agents still feel complicated and awkward.<br>And that's why it's a wonderful time to be building AI agents in 2026. |
| Bill Gurley's AI Thesis | Investment Thesis | Bill Gurley (@bgurley) CLEARLY outlines his AI thesis in 14 minutes to Tim Ferriss (@tferriss)<br>1. Every real tech shift that creates wealth also attracts speculation, and the two usually show up together<br>2. AI looks like an industrial wave where real companies and workflows get built, even while money moves too fast around it<br>3. Fast gains pull in people chasing exposure, which explains the rise of SPVs, loose deal structures, and crowded trades<br>4. Big companies take more risk when they feel like they’re winning, which is how all these circular AI deals start to appear<br>5. Private markets demand experience because outcomes swing hard and information stays messy<br>6. The biggest AI returns already happened early, which makes later bets harder and way more selective<br>7. Large model companies focus on core platforms, leaving plenty of room in specific industries and workflows<br>8. The strongest AI businesses live inside real day-to-day work, where systems get stitched together.<br>9. Becoming fluent with AI inside your own field is one of the smartest career moves right now. Its sound obvious but so true. <br>10. ""I dont care what field you are in you should be playing with this AI stuff. Be the most AI-enabled version of yourself"" |
| 2026: Year of Skills | Prediction | if 2025 was the year of ai agents, 2026 might be the year of “skills” for ai agents |
| OpenAI Agent Skills Structure | Tech Architecture | OpenAI just launched ""agent skills"", their version of what Claude calls skills. It finally clicked to me how these agents, skills and MCPs will work together.<br>Basically, a skill is just the recipe for how something should be done, subagents are extra hands you spin up when the task is big, and MCPs are how the agent actually touches real systems like your repo or dashboards.<br>Imagine a solo graphic designer setting up a “launch assets” skill: the skill defines brand rules, layouts, and export formats, sub-agents generate variations for social, web, and email in parallel, and MCPs pull from the actual Figma library and push finished assets into the client’s folder.<br>Cool to see this kind of structure emerge in both OpenAI and Claude.... it feels like an early step toward a common way of building workflows that are reliable, composable, and actually useful in real work.<br>I also gave away a trend, a business idea, an app ive been using for 14 years and more.<br>https://t.co/1OR5M7A0D2 (i answer every comment there)<br>Happy building, my friends.<br>Btw, what should I cover next? Or tag who should come on the show.<br>Have a creative day. |

| Future of Apps | Impact of vibe coding on app ecosystem | What happens to the App Store when vibe coding makes building apps 100× faster and cheaper?<br>A few things I think start to happen:<br>1. Apps increasingly launch for very specific moments instead of trying to keep users forever. You download it, get value, and move on.<br>2. Apps that solve a problem in under 30 seconds convert 2–3× better than apps that require onboarding.<br>3. A new pricing norm emerges: ~$1–$10 for one moment of value, paid instantly, with no expectation of future use. Disposable apps.<br>4. More examples of revenue concentrating at the account level, not the app level. You'll see seven/eight/even 9  igures across dozens of micro-apps.<br>5. Some of the most valuable apps never appear in App Store rankings because they spread peer-to-peer and are super niche. <br>6. Founders start shipping 10-20 micro-apps per year, expecting 1–2 to stick, instead of betting everything on one product.<br>7. The average successful app team trends toward 1–2 people, even at $1–5M ARR, because product surfaces stay small.<br>8. Distribution shifts toward people with trust. Creators, communities, and group chats quietly become the real app curators.<br>9. More extremely niche apps that didn't make sense to build are now being launched <br>10. Apps get named like content, not companies. Short, emotional, contextual names win.<br>11. App naming converges toward 5–8 character names because they perform better in links, sharing, and memory.<br>12. Apps win on tone and identity more than features. Two apps can do the same thing, but one feels like it’s “for you.”<br>13. The fastest growing category becomes “utility + identity” apps, tools that also signal taste or values.<br>14. Personalization becomes default. The same underlying app shows up in different versions depending on who you are and why you’re using it.<br>15. Launches start to look like content drops. Timing, story, and where an app shows up matter more than the tech itself.<br>16. Successful apps group into small bundles that match a lifestyle, job, or niche instead of standing alone.<br>17. Apple leans harder into bundles and curated experiences, acting more like a trusted editor than a giant directory.<br>18. Apple quietly favors apps that fit healthy usage patterns because it aligns with device trust.<br>19. Mobile vibe coding pushes creation onto the phone itself. People build apps while waiting, walking, or thinking, not sitting at a desk. Realistically not everyone will want to create apps, but 100x+ more do.<br>20. App fatigue increases, but software usefulness improves. People delete more apps and feel better about the ones they keep.<br>21. Over time, people stop saying “I use this app” and start saying “I made a small app for that.” |
| Role Convergence | Future of roles in tech | I think we’re heading toward a world where the designer, the engineer and the marketer become the same person. |
